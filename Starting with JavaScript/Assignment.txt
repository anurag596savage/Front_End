1. What can we achieve using Javascript ?

-> Websites + Presentation + Games + Mobile Apps

2. What was the initial name for Javascript ?

-> In September 1995, a Netscape programmer named Brandan Eich developed a new scripting language in just 10 days. It was originally named Mocha, but quickly became known as LiveScript and, later, JavaScript.

3. When was ECMAscript officially released ?

-> ECMAscript was released in 1997

4. Which of the following variable name is not valid in JavaScript ?

-> var my name = "John";

5. Which of the following are basic data types in Javascript ?

-> 
    1. Number
    2. Null
    3. Undefined
    4. String
    5. Object
    6. Boolean
    7. Symbol


6. How can you declare an integer ?

-> var a = 10;

7. Find out that if any of the lines below will produce an error on execution ?
    A) var a = 10;
    B) console.log(a)
    C) a = " 'Coding Ninjas' ";
    D) console.log(a);

-> No error


8. Write a program to swap the value of two variables.

->

var a = "5";
var b = "10";

var temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;

console.log("a is "+a);
console.log("b is "+b);

9.  What will be printed on the console from the following code -

    var a;
    console.log(a);

-> undefined

10. What will be printed on the console from the following code -

    var a = "A";
    console.log(65 - a);

-> NaN

11. What will the below statement print on the console ?

    typeof("-1")

-> 'string'

12. What is the below line print on the console?
    var a = null
    typeof(a)

-> 'object'


13. What will be the output of the following code ?

    var x = 4;
    var y = x++;
    y += 1;
    console.log(y);

->  5 
    In this line: var y = x++ the value of x is assigned to y before x is incremented,
    so y equals 4 on line 2, while x equals 5. Therefore on line 3, y now equals 5 instead of 6


14. What will be output of the statement given below ?

    console.log(20 + 12 * 2 - 10 / 2)

-> 39

15. What will the below line print on the console ?
    console.log(1 + '1')

-> 12

16. What will the below line print on the console ?
    var a;
    console.log(a + " b");

-> undefined b

17. What will the below line print on the console ?
    console.log(1 - '1')

-> 0

18. What will be the output for the below comparison in Javascript ?

    "1" == 1

-> true


19. What will be the output for the below comparison in Javascript ?

    null == undefined

->   true

    "null == undefined" means null is equal to undefined but not identical. In JavaScript, when you declare a variable without assigning any value. (that value is by default "undefined"), but When you assign a variable to a null value, then we are trying to convey that the variable is empty.So "null" and "undefined" both mean "nothing", so having them be equal makes intuitive sense.

20. What will the below code produce on the console ? 

    if( -1 ) {
        console.log("true")
    }
    else {
        console.log("false")
    }

-> true

21. What will the below code produce on the console ?

    if( "" ) {
        console.log("true")
    }
    else {
        console.log("false")
    }

-> false

22. Which of the following 'for' loops would not produce any error ?


    A) for(var i=0; i<5; ++i) { 
        console.log("Hello") ; 
    }

    B) var i , j ;    
    for(i=0, j = 10; i < 10, j < 100;) {
    console.log("Hello"); 
    }

    C) var i ;    
    for(i=0; i<5) { 
        console.log("Hello");  
    }

    D) var i , j ;    
    for(i=0, j=10; i<5; ++i) { 
        console.log("Hello"); 
    }

-> A and D 

23. Which of the following statements will print 'hii' at least once ?


    A) var i=10 ; 
    do { 
        console.log("hii"); 
        } while(i<5);

    B) var i=0 ;     
    while(i<5); { 
        console.log("hii"); 
        ++i ; 
    }

    C) for(i=0, j=10; i<5; ++i) { 
        if(i<5)
            break; 
        console.log("hii"); 
    }

    D) var i=0 ;     
    while(i<5) { 
        console.log("hii"); 
        ++i; 
        }

-> A and D

24. What will be the output of the following code:
    var a = 2;
    var b = 0;
    while(a <= 4){
        a++;
        b += a * 2;
        console.log(b);
    }

->  6 14 24
    The loop will run 3 times, before meeting the exit condition. 
    First value of b will be 3 * 2 = 6, followed by 6 + 4 * 2 = 14, and then value of 14 + 5 * 2 = 24.
